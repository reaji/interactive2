<br /><br /><div class="d1">Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
<br />Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
<br />Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
<br />And summer's lease hath all too short a date;
<br />Sometime too hot the <strong class="eyes">eye</strong> of heaven shines,
<br />And often is his gold complexion dimmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm'd;
<br />And every fair from fair sometime declines,
<br />By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd;
<br />But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
<br />Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st;
<br />Nor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade,
<br />When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st:
<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <strong>So long as men can breathe or <strong class="eyes">eyes</strong> can see,
<br />&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.</strong>
<br />
